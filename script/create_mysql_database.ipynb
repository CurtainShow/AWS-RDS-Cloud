This is what I love about good science fiction - it pushes your thinking about where things can go. \\n It is a 2015 Hugo winner, and translated from its original Chinese, which made it interesting in just a different way from most things I\\'ve read. For instance the intermixing of Chinese revolutionary history - how they kept accusing people of being \"reactionaries\", etc. \\n It is a book about science, and aliens. The science described in the book is impressive - its a book grounded in physics and pretty accurate as far as I could tell. (view spoiler)[Though when it got to folding protons into 8 dimensions I think he was just making stuff up - interesting to think about though. \\n But what would happen if our SETI stations received a message - if we found someone was out there - and the person monitoring and answering the signal on our side was disillusioned? That part of the book was a bit dark - I would like to think human reaction to discovering alien civilization that is hostile would be more like Enders Game where we would band together. \\n I did like how the book unveiled the Trisolaran culture through the game. It was a smart way to build empathy with them and also understand what they\\'ve gone through across so many centuries. And who know a 3 body problem was an unsolvable math problem? But I still don\\'t get who made the game - maybe that will come in the next book. \\n I loved this quote: \\n \"In the long history of scientific progress, how many protons have been smashed apart in accelerators by physicists? How many neutrons and electrons? Probably no fewer than a hundred million. Every collision was probably the end of the civilizations and intelligences in a microcosmos. In fact, even in nature, the destruction of universes must be happening at every second--for example, through the decay of neutrons. Also, a ',\n",

The book is about the quantum theory of many worlds which states that all decisions we make throughout our lives basically create branches, and that each possible path through the decision tree can be thought of as a parallel world. And in this book, someone invents a way to switch between these worlds. This was nicely alluded to/foreshadowed in this quote: \\n \"I think about all the choices we\\'ve made that created this moment. Us sitting here together at this beautiful table. Then I think of all the possible events that could have stopped this moment from ever happening, and it all feels, I don\\'t know...\" \"What?\" \"So fragile.\" Now he becomes thoughtful for a moment. He says finally, \"It\\'s terrifying when you consider that every thought we have, every choice we could possibly make, branches into a new world.\" \\n (view spoiler)[This book can\\'t be discussed without spoilers. It is a book about choice and regret. Ever regret not chasing the girl of your dreams so you can focus on your career? Well Jason2 made that choice and then did regret it. Clearly the author is trying to tell us to optimize for happiness - to be that second rate physics teacher at a community college if it means you can have a happy life. I\\'m being snarky because while there is certainly something to that, you also have to have meaning in your life that comes from within. I thought the book was a little shallow on this dimension. In fact, all the characters were fairly shallow. Daniela was the perfect wife. Ryan the perfect antithesis of Jason. Amanda the perfect loyal traveling companion, etc. This, plus the fact that the book was weak on the science are what led me to take a few stars off - but I\\'d still read it again if I could go back in time - was a very fun and engaging read. \\n If you want to really minimize regret, you have to live your life to avoid it in the first place.

       "  'I really enjoyed this book, and there is a lot to recommend it. It did drag on a little at the end so I knocked off 1 star - but overall a wow book. \\n It\\'s the story of a starship sent to Tau Ceti - the nearest star that has Earth analog planets - to colonize it. The journey there will take generations, and the story is told of the 3rd & 4th (?) generations, which are the ones that reaches Tau Ceti. It is a story of purpose, and how having a purpose affects behavior. A story of politics, and people. \\n The first cool thing about this book is the richness of its world. The ship is intricate and large in its design and ambition to shepherd ~1200 people for that much time. It had 3D printers that can print almost anything you can imagine - even DNA - or more printers - so little goes lacking that can\\'t be recreated. \\n But the thing that makes this book brilliant is the Ship. The AI that controls the ship, who is narrating the book by the end. It\\'s observations about humans and our language are just brilliant. It starts with the astute observation that human language is very imprecise, and relies heavily on metaphor and analogy. It is remarkable once you start to reflect on it, how true that is. To hear the AI reflect on this: \\n \"Perhaps there is a provisional solution to this epistemological mess, which is to be located in the phrase \"it is as if\". This phrase is of course precisely the announcement of an analogy. And on reflection, it is admittedly a halting problem, but jumping out of it, there is something quite suggestive and powerful in this formulation, something very specifically human.

       "  'A beautiful story. It is rare to encounter a book that does such a good job painting the scenes in your mind - you really felt like you were there and got to know the characters and the people they came across. I generally love WWII books and movies, but wasn\\'t sure if I\\'d like one featuring a blind girl and a young Nazi radio operator - but he brings a lot of life to them. \\n That said, the novel drifts around a lot, and the plotline jumping forward and backward in time drove me nuts. \\n I thought a lot about if there is a theme to the book. One was the diamond and if it was really cursed (based on the Hope Diamond perhaps?). Another is that 20K Leagues is an awesome book. But I think the book was a lot about fear and the unknown, and how people deal with it. Marie-Laure was blind and couldn\\'t tell what was happening around her - yet she was the bravest one. Werner was afraid of ending up as a miner, which drove him to join the army, and learn about radios. And Uncle Etienne was afraid dying from a sniper he couldn\\'t see, so he didn\\'t leave his house and he created a radio transmitter. So the moral of the story is... don\\'t be paralyzed by your fears. \\n This, she realizes, is the basis of his fear, all fear. That a light you are powerless to stop will turn on you and usher a bullet to its mark.\"',\n",

       "  'Another hard to put down nonfiction book from Erik Larson. I really enjoyed this book - mostly to learn more about submarine warfare in WWI, but also to learn about the history of the time. How America entered the war, the importance of shipping to England, the ruthlessness and autonomy of German u-boat commanders. Larson also did a great job of layering in interesting historical info (though he overdid it too a little bit). \\n One of the dramas of the story of the Lusitania that Larson focuses on is if the British wanted the Lusitania to be sunk, to help draw America into the war. His conclusion seems to be that was the case, though there isn\\'t conclusive evidence. Before the Lusitania sank, very few Americans had died in the war, and there were hundreds of Americans on the boat when it sank, which definitely helped change America\\'s attitude. And even then, it took 2 years after it sank for America\\'s troops to arrive. \\n \"the most likely explanation is that there was indeed a plot, however imperfect, to endanger the Lusitania in order to involve the United States in the war.\" \\n Some of my favorite details from the book were simply about what it took to navigate a u-boat in WW1. For instance: \\n \"In this day before sonar, a submarine traveled utterly blind, trusting entirely in the accuracy of sea charts. One great fear of all U-boat men was that a half-sunk derelict or an uncharted rock might lie in their path.\" \\n Which is crazy! Plus, the torpedoes weigh 3 thousand pounds each, so a boat could only carry ~7, and their failure rate was something like 60%. Also, they had limited fuel and operated only on batteries when submerged so they could only stay underwater for limited amounts of time. Given all this, trying to operate a u-boat to sink other boats is a pretty dangerous sounding game of chess. But they certainly had an effect on the war - at one point Britain estimated it would have to surrender in 3 months if it didn\\'t get more supplies. \\n There were a lot of int',\n",

The great thing about a good Stephenson book is it makes you think about the future in new ways, and this book was no exception. \\n It was really two books, and I certainly didn't see the second one coming. It starts out in modern times and then someone blows up the moon. We don't have time to find out who, as within a few years the fragments of the moon cause the worst asteriod shower earth has ever seen and wipe out all life in earth. We have time to send 1,500 people up into space - and this is their story. \\n The use of robots throughout the books was fascinating to me. Stephenson has clearly looked 10-20 years into our future and correctly predicted how it will go. From robot workers in space, nano-bots, nano-robot weapons, and more - we get a vivid portrayal of how robots might be a part of our future lives. \\n I thought the focus on use of whip technology in space was interesting. And of course, the whole notion of Cradle was just cool - though not sure about it's feasibility.\",\n",

I got interested in this book after seeing the movie, which I really enjoyed. The book is similar - maybe a bit more poetic - but I think the plot in the movie is a bit improved (not much, but a bit). \\n I imagine this book came about because Neil read the below poem that he includes in the beginning, and then he invented a plot around it. The result is the book reads like a epic poem - it\\'s creative, magical, and really, just right. \\n Go and catch a falling star, \\n Get with child a mandrake root, \\n Tell me where all past years are, \\n Or who cleft the devil\\'s foot, \\n Teach me to hear mermaids singing, \\n Or to keep off envy\\'s stinging, \\n And find \\n What wind \\n Serves to advance an honest mind. \\n If thou be\\'st born to strange sights, \\n Things invisible to see, \\n Ride ten thousand days and nights, \\n Till age snow white hairs on thee, \\n Thou, when thou return\\'st, wilt tell me, \\n All strange wonders that befell thee, \\n And swear, \\n No where \\n Lives a woman true, and fair. \\n If thou find\\'st one, let me know, \\n Such a pilgrimage were sweet; \\n Yet do not, I would not go, \\n Though at next door we might meet; \\n Though she were true, when you met her, \\n And last, till you write your letter, \\n Yet she \\n Will be \\n False, ere I come, to two, or three. \\n And here is my new favorite quote: \"Have been unavoidably detained by the world.

I love post apocalyptic books as they are great canvas\\'s for humanity, and what matters. In Station Eleven an Ebola-esque virus (the Georgia Flu) knocks out over 99% of the worlds population. This story is told half right before the collapse, and half afterwards, and has several threads that tie together nicely. \\n Reading how civilization and infrastructure all die after the collapse is fascinating. One by one, cable tv, the internet, water, and power all eventually stop working. Nobody is alive to maintain them - or who even knows how. Other infrastructure like gasoline to power cars and airplanes, groceries, guns, and even clothing all become rarer and rarer commodities. Really makes you realize how much we are standing on the shoulder of hundreds of years of progress and knowledge, and how far into the middle ages we could easily fall. We really know nothing individually - our civilization is based upon the collective knowledge of billions. \\n If there is a motto of the book, it\\'s probably this quote: \"Because survival is insufficient\". Humanity craves for more than survival - we crave for something more out of life. The story follows a caravan of actors and musicians who travel from town to town to play Shakespeare, and bring some art and a shared experience. Interesting that of all the artists from the past 400 years, Shakespeare is the one that survives and still resonates. \\n \"All three caravans of the Traveling Symphony are labeled as such, THE TRAVELING SYMPHONY lettered in white on both sides, but the lead caravan carries an additional line of text: Because survival is insufficient.\" \\n \"Survival might be insufficient, she\\'d told Dieter in late-night arguments, but on the other hand, so was Shakespeare.\" \\n The storyline pre-collapse that follows Arthur and his three wives is interesting.

I think the first book was by far the best, but this gave us a nice conclusion. \\n (view spoiler)[It was the conclusion we wanted to see - the people finally get outside! My problem with this book is there were lots of holes. A lot of the other reviews have pointed this out too, and I'm not sure if the fact I know it was self-published is biasing me to say it could have used more editing, but feels that way a little. But the writing was great. \\n There were lots of things that weren't cleared up or never really fully made sense. The major one is why Thurman really felt the need to destroy the whole world - feels like there could have been a lot more to that. It also wasn't clear how he really accomplished that - was it all nuclear or was it nano? If nuclear, wouldn't the world really be a wasteland? \\n Whatever happened to silo 40 and other silo's that went dark? I was kind of expecting that they had already broken outside and would have been waiting there. Or perhaps they already went to the sea and Hugh will tell us their story later. \\n What happens to the other silos after silo one is destroyed? Didn't it power their server rooms and probably provide other stuff including guidance to the silo heads? Will they make the 200 years on their own? \\n The mystery of silo 17 and why the dead bodies at the top didn't rot was never really explained. I'm guessing they were kept whole by healing nano's, but it felt like there was more to that story. \\n I didn't understand why Anna didn't come back to life. If Thurman could do so after being killed by Donald, why not her? All the love stories (Juliet and Kyle, Donald and Anna, etc ended up sadly - I wanted one happy one.

I liked how it unfolded - we learn about the state of the world and what has happened to it very piecemeal throughout the book, and I think if Atwood had just described it all up front it wouldn\\'t have been nearly as compelling. \\n This book seems to be a kind of warning. It describes a future state that is chilling and depressing, and yet (to the point) chillingly possible. It describes a society that has - for reasons we never quite learn (but might have to do with radiation or sterilization?) remade itself from one where everyone has basic freedom and choice, to one that is the opposite of that. Pleasure, poverty, and other evils are eliminated in this system. And most chillingly, women have almost no rights. The books main character is a \"hand maiden\" who\\'s only role is to bear children from the person who seems to have purchased/acquired her for that purpose. She doesn\\'t even have a proper name anymore - she is called \"Offred\" because she is the property \"of Fred\". \\n \"We were a society dying, said Aunt Lydia, of too much choice.\" \\n A lot of the book explores themes like the above - what it would be like to take away basic freedoms, choices, and also ability to have relationships with others. Chilling and depressing, because so much of what we value in modern society is our freedom. And yet, we do know that too much choice does paralyze, and many people want leaders and situations that simplify the decisions they have to make. This might sound like a balance, but its not, because our ability to make choice, especially bad choices, is actually crucial to our development. \\n \"Better never means better for everyone, he says. It always means worse, for some.\" \\n This was an insightful sentence, because it implied the commander thought they were making society better, not worse, overall.

Also pretty amazing is that it was self-published. \\n There were two great things about this book: the humor and the science.

I didn\\'t double-check all the science, but loved the descriptions of all the math: calorie calculations, creating water, etc. Just fun stuff. \\n But the humor was top notch. Weir does a great job portraying a stranded man trying to remain upbeat by talking to himself in log entries. And the excellent audio narrator only made it better. \\n \"I started the day with some nothin\\' tea. Nothin\\' tea is easy to make.

A grad student (Eric) has left his annotated copy of SOT (Ship of Theseus) in the library, and an undergrad (Jen) finds it and replies to his annotations. This leads to them making exciting discoveries about the book, and also falling in love. \\n The first thing is this book is just beautifully printed. It looks and feels like a classic book, to the point where people would ask me why I\\'m reading such an old book. The marginalia feels real, and I can only imagine how hard that was to print. This is one that will be cool to keep on the shelves. Only complaint is the inserts are a cool idea, but they fall out all the time, and at this point I have no idea which pages they were supposed to be on. \\n The most interesting thing about this book to me is that it\\'s a blueprint for how people discuss books. Sometimes they discuss the content of the book. Other times they use the content as a jumping off point to have a personal discussion. The nature of this book shows both, almost split 50/50. A key difference with this book - and the genius of it - is that most of us have to rely on memory to start a conversation with someone about a particular event or passage in the book. Here, our characters can literally underline a phrase like \"relationships\" and then talk about what is happening in their relationship at the moment. \\n One thing I didn\\'t realize until later in the book is that the ship of Theseus is a real thing - it\\'s an ancient Greek philosophical question - if you replace all the parts of something, is it still the same object? This inspires the ship that S is captured on, which sails through the mists of time, always getting fixed when needed. It\\'s a ship that can\\'t die. Or a series of ships :) \\n I found the story of Jen & Eric a lot more comp',\n",

Set in Kingsbridge but a few centuries later, the story has a lot of similar elements: a cathedral that needs repair, a brilliant young builder (Merthin), a love story, a priorship up for grabs, and of course political manuevering, backstabbing and evil church officials. Also like the first one, the characters were developed well, the book was hard to put down, and yet it wasn't a deep book, just a fun one. Thank goodness I finished - it was causing me to lose sleep. \\n I did enjoy learning about the plague, and medieval ideas on health and medicine. Amazing that the plague wiped about a third of the human population, and how little they knew about it. Was frustrated by the lack of the Monks openness to learn new things, and how little they trusted women. For instance they believed in bleeding as a solution to everything when it actually is harmful in most cases. Also was interesting that there was no such thing as a doctor - instead nuns/monks/etc served that role.\",\n",

It dominates search and social media, has a huge sprawling campus in the south bay, and is full of intelligent, ambitious young employees. This story is I think a take on where the connected nature of the internet might be taking us. It's essentially a discussion about privacy vs openness, and I think a serious 1984-esque warning about being too open. \\n I thought a lot of the book was kind of shallow and unrealistic. The characters weren't very well developed. And I can't imagine an HR department that would get on your case for not using social media or attending a brunch you were invited too - it was just too extreme to believe. But I suppose that was on purpose, as the author was just making a point. I appreciated the point (see below), but didn't love the story. \\n Mark Zuckerberg has been fairly public on saying that he believes a more open society is a better one. The notion is exactly the one Mae learns with the kayak incident - if your whole life is open to your friends and family, it's very hard to do anything dishonest or that you might regret. The premise of the Circle - that privacy and secrecy are bad - is taking this idea to an extreme that I doubt Zuckerberg or anyone else who runs a social network has ever contemplated: complete openness. Or as its motto says: \\n All That Happens Must Be Known. \\n It is easy to imagine us eventually living in a world like the Circle contemplates.

Already there are startups like Dropcam that enable public video feeds that are archived. There are atm and building and traffic cameras everywhere that the police already use.

This is a bit of an odd thing to have happened, but it gives us a nice palette to think about things. \\n Everything is rationed, including how many children you can have. People self-identify by their profession and where in the silo they live: farmers and mechanics in the lowers, IT in the mids, and professional class in the uppers. The working class wear color coded uniforms to easily distinguish them. \\n The book was a lot about control. How to control a contained civilization, and give them hope (eg a live feed of the outside) and yet keep them in harmony and doing their functions. Strange mechanisms of control were built all over the silo: communication was oddly limited given the IT resources they have - many messages had to be delivered by courier as emails cost valuable money to send. Most strange of all - there is no elevator, which forces anyone wanting to travel the length of the silo to spend 2-3 days on the journey. \\n The cleaning ritual was a strange bit of culture. (view spoiler)[Upon reflection, I can see why it was necessary. If people never go outside, uncertainty of it still being bad would creep in, and people would need to try it. As perhaps happened in Silo 17. (hide spoiler)] \\n I really liked the unraveling of Bernard, and how he went from repulsive/annoying, to understandable once you understood his role and responsibility. (view spoiler)[His role is to eliminate any doubt in the delicate balance of the silo. Opening the book up with the doubt of Holston was brilliant as it sucked you in immediately.

Written by the founder of Rhapsody, who knows a thing or two about music and the copyright surrounding it. What I didn't expect from a book by an entrepreneur is a funny book - and this book is not bad. It is being compared to Hitchhikers Guide, which nothing can approach, but its not bad. My only gripe would be there are a ton of footnotes that attempt to extend the humor and most of them didn't work for me. \\n The basic premise of the book is brilliant; that aliens have been listening to - and thus pirating - our music since 1977, without our knowledge. Because US copyright law states that a single case of intentional copyright violation can be fined $150,000 - this means the entire universe is many times over in debt to humanity. \\n It's pretty ridiculous that the music industry got such a big fine to be passed.

Louie Zamperini truly went through hell and came back - and it's inspiring to read a story of such willpower and determination. It was also interesting to me to learn more about Japan and their role in the war. \\n One big takeaway was just how cheap human life is in war. I think there was some stat about how 5/6 of the US airmen that died did so from accidents - that is simply staggering. \\n I love WWII stories, but most of the ones I've seen and read have focused on Germany, so I really didn't know much about how Japan had treated their POW's. It was pretty eye opening to read the stats about how they pretty much massacred hundreds of thousands of POW's. And of couse, as the story details, they also did not follow Geneva Conventions and pretty much treated POW's as slaves. \\n One of my favorite points the author made is best illustrated by this quote about Dignity is as essential to human life as water, food, and oxygen. This is a fundamental truth of humanity that the author really drew out well - if you take a persons dignity away you take everything away. I loved all the stories of POW's being defiant; stealing food, supplies, playing jokes, etc. The little bits of defiance were enough to let them take back their dignity, and I think thats what makes them so compelling; because while we haven't all been POW's, we can relate to that basic need.\",\n",

Nothing new or exciting really revealed, and I'm sure there are many other accounts of the buildup to ww2 out there, but this one told it from the perspective of mostly the Ambassador, Dodd, and his daughter, Martha. The story was engaging and well-written, and thus interesting. I think the ending fell pretty flat - I was hoping for more. \\n Reading about the Nazis one is of course always appalled at how they got to be in power and commit such atrocities, and this book did provide some clues. Hitler seemed primarily willing to tell people what they needed and wanted to hear, even if it wasn't the truth - and he was a great storyteller. He also used fear as a primary weapon, as there were many in Germany not behind him - but they were too afraid to make a stand or speak up. \\n I suppose the climax of the book was the Night of the Long Knives, where Hitler arrested and executed all of his major opponents, clearing the way for his absolute grip on the nation. He ruthlessly murdered an estimated 77 to several hundred people (the count was never really known) and played it off as putting down a rebellion, which much of the world bought for many years. \\n I think one of the more interesting pieces of the book was watching Dodd (and Martha) go from thinking the Nazis were good for Germany, to realizing how terrible they were and hoping for them to be overthrown. It was a slow gradual process, and one that I'm sure was not immediately obvious to anyone. In the end, I think the book is aptly named.\",\n",

Later revealed to be a journal in other stories. A story about a rather weak-willed protagonist, who is constantly taken advantage of by others (the ships captain, Dr Goose).

The story is told through letters to a friend, Sixsmith, who appears in the next story. The story is about how Frobisher, the apprentice, goes from being overjoyed to have a job to being resentful that the master is using him and stealing his stuff. Robert sleeps with VA's wife the whole story, but ends up falling in love with the daughter in a cruel twist of fate. \\n Story 3: Luisa Rey. Modern age story about a young journalist hot on the heels of a big scandal involving an energy company. Sixsmith is an engineer who leaks the story to her, and also has the letters from story #2. Classic detective-esque story, with lots of people willing to kill to protect their secrets and power. \\n Story 4: Timothy Cavendish.

Very enjoyable quick read - couldn't put it down - it was like crack. \\n I'm a bit bothered by the lack of backstory of how Panem and the Hunger Games come about. It is just kind of explained away in a few paragraphs and we are left to accept this very strange world where teenagers are pitted into an arena each year to kill each other? I was expecting it because I've seen Battle Royale, but I would have appreciated knowing more of the backstory of how the world could have come into such a odd state. \\n I suppose what makes a book like this interesting is thinking about the strategy of it all. The players are going to be statistically encouraged to band together because they will last longer that way, but by definition of course any partnership will be broken, and the drama of how that unfolds is always interesting and full of friendships broken and betrayal. Each character approached the game in their own way. Some banded together in larger coalitions, some were loners initially and banded together later. And some were just loners, like Foxface. A lot depended on your survival skill: could you find food and water on your own? Self-dependence is highly valued - and of course our hero was strong there. \\n All in all, a fun read, but I feel kind of dirty for having read it.\",\n",

Success, it seems, is due primarily to hard work and circumstance - brains play little part. \\n Gladwell went through several (fascinating) examples proving his thesis - people such as Bill Gates, Joe Flom at Skadden, Oppenheimer, some failed genius named Chris Langan. All of them had two things in common: they spent over 10,000 hours doing what they did, and they had fortunate circumstances that let them get ahead of everyone else. Bill Gates was smart, but so were lots of other geeks. He had the advantage of being 16 when the computing age came about, and being possibly the only 16 year old in the country with access to a computer - and he spent all his time on it. By the time he hit college he had well over 10,000 hours of computer time and was arguably one of the foremost experts in the country. \\n One of my favorite bits was the music study on page 39 that compared musicians, and \"couldn\\'t find any \\'naturals\\'\" - the skill of each musician at comparable amounts of practice was equal. It\\'s kind of validating to hear this, as many of us have this feeling that there are naturally smarter people out there than us. But apparently this isn\\'t true - and I think my personal experience agrees with this. The harder you work, the better you can do. \\n One other big takeaway was how circumstance can change things. The hockey league study and elementary school studies were fascinating and relevant. Basically kids that are in the older third of their class (or hockey league) have a natural advantage when they\\'re really little. They are the kids who make all-star, and get extra coaching, and because of that they practice more and thus do become better by the time they are older. I was held back in pre-school so I was one of the oldest in my class, and I definitely think it helped me. Hmmm now can I plan my kids to be born ',\n",

I think all Americans need to read this book, as it helps to understand and sympathize with what the people in Afghanistan have gone through. Particularly interesting as the book spans 30+ years and paints a very graphic picture of how Afghanistan changed in that time. From Russian communists to warlords to the Taliban to US Army, there have been no shortage of invaders and wars, and victims. Khaled leaves out little of the misery and death, but also focuses on how life invariably always finds a way. \\n So a little sad, but I liked it.

Watching Mike try to grok humans gave a Heinlein great opportunities to point out some of our faults - and our advantages. \\n I think my favorite part of this book is the word \\'grok\\'. I would bet that there are deep discussions over the true meaning of this word - but I will contend that its closest meaning in English is \\'to be enlightened about something\\'. If you grok God you have reached enlightenment. If you grok music you truly understand in the way that Mozart understood it. If you grok another person you love them. If you grok programming then you truly love and are really good at programming - that, and you\\'re also a probably a pretty big nerd for using a word like \\'grok\\' :) I used it in front of my girlfriend and she still hasn\\'t forgiven me, since I had to explain that it was \"a Martian word\"! \\n One thing that I grokked (yes I\\'m going to keep using it dammit) after finishing this book is that it is kind of a 60\\'s manifesto for free love.

I tore through it in one day! \\n It really dove into what it\\'s like to be in the spy world. A world where, as Le Carre mentions several times in the novel, the only rule is to do what\\'s best for your country. When you play that kind of game morals are thrown out the window. Murder, traitorism, disloyalty - are all ok in the name of great good. And operatives who live in this world have a hard time \"coming in from the cold\" - as did Laemas. \\n The description of how Laemas had to go to personally go to pieces in order to get thrown in jail and get recruited by the Germans was impressive. He had to basically pretend to become an alcoholic, start sucking at his job, ostracize all his friends and anyone he met, and hit total rock bottom, until he was thrown in jail. That\\'s impressive. Not something I think most people could do - which is why the Spy world is such and interesting one. \\n The issue of the unmorality of the spy world was Liz (Laemas\\' love interest)\\'s main issue with the events. But Laemas was hardened to it and still looked at it from the greater good angle - though people were killed in the end it was a win for London, after all. It was interesting that the last lines of the novel had him thinking about some kids he almost ran over in his car once: as though he wanted to get back to that place where normal rules applied.',\n",

       "  'This book was a pure delight. The subtitle \"Adventures of a Curious Character\" is spot-on. Feynman gave an amazingly human and honest view into his philosophy and take on life, thought a series of stories. \\n One thing that struck me most deeply was his passion for learning new things. You would think a world-famous Physicist would just be passionate for Physics - but Feynman was curious about everything he saw. He dabbled in art and was successful enough to have a show, he joined a Brazilian Bongo group and competed with them, he hung out in Vegas until he grokked gambling, he spent time in strip bars in Arizona until he figured out how to pick up women, he cracked safes in Los Alamos for fun - the list goes on! My take: you should have your passions - but you should also have your hobbies. I think I need a new hobby :) \\n I really enjoyed his lessons learned from observing the Brazilian educational system. He noted that many of the students were simply memorizing words and formulas and had no understanding of the concepts they applied to. I think this is not a unique problem in education. \\n Another lesson learned from Feynman\\'s studies of science is to never take any data for granted. Always always question the sources. Whenever Feynman did an experiment he would re-generate many of the numbers on his own - even if they had been published in other places. For many things we are (and not just in science) standing on the shoulders of giants. The easiest way to be led astray is if those results were never right to begin with. \\n I think Feynman was in his heart a true educator and scientist, with real integrity. And I think it drove him nuts how many important decisions are made using unscientific principles. This book was a light-hearted attempt to point that out - not to mention, a very entertaining read.',\n",

It read like a bestseller (quick read), but had a lot of substance to stop and make you think. \\n three Rules of the tipping point: the law of the few, the stickyness factor, the power of context. \\n Law of the Few (people who influence): \\n - Connectors: super connectors (eg Paul Revere). William Dawes had the same mission as Paul Revere the same night but we haven\\'t heard of him b/c Paul Revere was a super-connector & knew who to rouse. \\n - Mavens: A Maven is a person who has information on a lot of different products or prices or places. This person likes to initiate discussions with consumers and respond to requests. They like to be helpers in the marketplace. \\n - Salesmen: people with the skills of persuasion. Good at reading people entering into \"conversational harmony\" with them. Facial gestures (nods, smiles, frowns) are key indicators. Emotional Mimicry. Studies showed Peter Jennings viewers voted Republican b/c he unconsciously smiled more while covering Reagan. \\n Stickyness Factor \\n - Sesame street succeeded b/c it learned to make TV sticky. It did a TON of testing with focus groups of kids to increase stickyness (how much kids remembered) of each show. They would cut scenes that didn\\'t hold attention until each show \\n was good. \\n - Blues Clues did even more testing and discovered that kids love repetition - it plays the same show 5 times in a row and kids love it. \\n - make the message personal to make it memorable \\n The Power of Context \\n - Broken window theory. NYC cleaned up its crime epidemic by cleaning off the graffiti from its subways. \\n - Often to change human behavior you have to change the context the problem is presented in. \\n - Stanford Prison Experiment by Zimbardo proved that context matters. \\n - law of 150: a person can\\'t \\'know\\' more than 150 people, so companies usually start to fail at that point.

Learning more about the efforts of Bletchley Park, and Dr Alan Turing and huffduff and cribs, etc was fascinating. \\n I think the funniest part of the book is the page where Stephenson actually graphs out how productive Waterhouse is when he has recently had sex (very productive) and when he hasn't (not very productive). \\n The code-breaking and cryptography is not stuff I know a ton about, as modern day programmers largely don't have to worry about that stuff, but it's a good reminder to think about, as we don't have it on our brains nearly enough. Avi & Randy's paranoia and tendency to encrypt everything from their hard drives to their emails may be overkill, on the other hand, it also may be wise. I remember getting email from people who used public/private keys to encrypt their email before, but not in the last 5 years. Maybe we should request that Gmail Labs add that! \\n If there was a theme to this book, it's that cryptography is everything. It defined the second world war, and it also defines the modern internet. Information is king - not large caches of gold.\",\n",

One of the best-second chance romances I\\'ve ever read. \\n Kennedy and Johnny fell in love when they were just in high school. Johnny was a naturally-gifted actor and left his family behind to follow his dreams of becoming an actor. Kennedy ran away with him to Hollywood when she was just 17, giving up her dreams to follow his. Real life brutally intruded, and Kennedy left Johnny after he got his first big break. He quickly got lost in the throes of addiction and the Hollywood party scene. Broken-hearted and pregnant, Kennedy returned home to begin a new life without Johnny. \\n \"You don\\'t know this, but that girl? She doesn\\'t need a house. She doesn\\'t even need an apartment. She would\\'ve slept in the car. She wouldn\\'t have complained at all about it. You didn\\'t have to sell it, but you did, and as grateful as she is for that, she already feels guilty. She\\'s worried, and she\\'s scared, that this won\\'t be a story of triumph. Because she believes in you. She wouldn\\'t be there if she didn\\'t. But the world isn\\'t always kind to good people. Sometimes it eats them alive.\" \\n Johnny grew up wealthy but in a very abusive household. Acting was his escape. He had no choice but to get away from his family in any way he could. But he never really left his demons behind and now that he is a world-famous superstar, he wants to make amends with Kennedy and with Madison, the daughter he never knew. \\n \"I don\\'t deserve her time, not in the least, but I\\'m so desperate for some part of this woman back that I\\'ll steal every second that I can get.\" \\n Kennedy gave up everything for Madison, a gorgeous, smart and funny little girl. Kennedy works at a dead-end job, struggling to make ends meet. She is still in love with Johnny but has been hurt by him many times over the years. I was SO emotional while reading this book! It had everything I love about a second chance romance. The writing is clever and creative ',\n",

Addictive, funny and fast-paced, this book might be my favorite in the series so far. \\n Easton Royal is a high school senior at the very exclusive Astor Park Prep. This is a school filled with ultra-rich students complete with trust funds and designer clothes and huge mansions. Easton is a flirt and a partier and sets his sights on the new girl in school, Hartley. They are complete opposites but that is part of the fun of this book. Hartley is not at all interested in bad-boy Easton so he settles for the friend zone. \\n \"I need to treat her as a friend. A real, give-a-shit-about-each-other, don\\'t-need-to-be-naked-to-care-about-you friend.\" \\n This book should not be read as a standalone because it does contain some spoilers from the earlier books. I am SO glad I stuck with this series because I LOVED Easton\\'s story! He has a good heart and realizes that his partying is getting out of hand, especially as the son of a mother who had severe addiction issues. I fell in love with Easton and my heart broke for him!! \\n \"I\\'m the only one here, drinking crap I can\\'t stand because I don\\'t want to spend a minute of my life alone. My head\\'s a bad, bad place.\" \\n I really felt the connection between Easton and Hartley and loved the supporting characters. \\'Fallen Heir\\' is a crisply written and juicy story that is perfect for all fans of contemporary Young Adult books. This book just clicked for me. And I loved how funny Easton was. His humor and satire was just what this story needed. \\n \"I might be small, but I have the lung capacity of a whale, so if you don\\'t move I\\'m gonna have to release the oral Kraken until the entire',\n",

       "  '\"I promise to love you forever. As long as there is love in this world, we will be a part of it.\" \\n So sweet!! Filled with tons of romance and some real emotion. Don\\'t read any spoilers for this book! I\\'m glad I didn\\'t know anything about it. \\n Renee Carlino\\'s books ALWAYS captivate me. \\'Swear on This Life\\' is one of my all-time favorite stories. I will say that Adam is definitely my favorite thing about this book. *SIGH* Adam is one of the most memorable characters ever created by Ms. Carlino. Impulsive, sweet, charming, creative and loving, he really puts himself out there when he meets Charlotte. While I\\'m not always a fan of insta-love, it just WORKED here. Charlotte opened up her heart to Adam because he seemed, well, absolutely perfect. \\n I was absolutely enchanted by Adam and could understand how Charlotte fell for him. But life has a funny way of working out and things don\\'t turn out quite how Charlotte expected. There was definitely something off about Adam right from the beginning but I couldn\\'t put my finger on it. \\n \"You\\'re stunning and beautiful and I loved every second of it. I\\'m sorry you didn\\'t like it. Did I hurt you.?\" \\n \"No, but are you going to paint it?\" \\n \"Paint what?\" \\n \"Us, what we just did?\" \\n \"No.\" \\n \"No?\" \\n \"No. I don\\'t need to. I\\'ll never forget it and it\\'s sacred.\" \\n The story took a lot of twists and turns and it was definitely one that I was not expecting!! Charlotte has had terrible luck at relationships and let\\'s just say that Adam does not turn out to be everything she expected or imagined. Nonetheless, he still feels like the one love of her life, even though they spent a very short time together. \\n Life moves on and Charlotte gets back in to the dating scene. She meets the adorable Seth, who is a minor-league baseball player. He really likes her but she can\\'t quite forget Adam. Seth is patient and sexy and athletic and funny and smart and is just an all-around wonderful man!! But can Charlotte move on from her brief time with Adam',\n",

       "  '4.5 Kinky Stars!! \\n Eve Dangerfield continues to delight with this verrrrrrry kinky and totally filthy story! But she also manages to be funny, heartfelt and utterly original. Highly recommend! \\n \"Everyone is weird, Kate, we\\'re the perfect kind of weird for each other.\" \\n Yes, this book is about Daddy kink and it is oh so perfect! Eve Dangerfield writes smart, funny, nuanced characters which is what makes this story so readable. Kate is a young professional who has hidden her sexual fantasies away in shame. The focus of her current obsession is her boss, Ty, a 45 year old gruff, sexy former firefighter who pushes all her buttons. \\n \"Her obsession wasn\\'t even original. Everyone had a crush on Tyler Henderson. Women, gay men, straight men, more perceptive animals. It was like having a crush on a Hemsworth brother--it made you basic as hell. \\n But she thinks Ty can\\'t stand her because he can barely stand to be in the same room as her. He never speaks to her, calls her by her work nickname, and is generally just an all-around grouch. But...but...she\\'s actually perfect for him! Because you see, Ty has always craved D/lg kink but has also hidden it away in shame, settling for unsatisfying relationships that make him feel empty and wanting more. \\n \"Ty didn\\'t think Middleton was a great girl. He thought Middleton was a pain in the ass. Waltzing around with her shiny hair and long legs and her throaty voice, being cuter than a fistful of buttons. Where did she get off? \\n This book is filled with SO much hotness and hilarity and dirty talk that I couldn\\'t believe what I was reading! But the story is SO engaging that I fell in love with Ty from the very first page. And the letter he writes to Kate!! OMG. *Faints* \\n Ty and Kate are so perfect together but only Kate is brave enough to be honest with Ty and her feelings. I LOVED how she accepted what she wanted and who she was and never wavered. Ty was another story. He denied his true desires and felt shame for what he wanted. \\n',\n",

       "  '\"Out of all the places we could be, we\\'re right here. At the same time.\" \\n Colleen Hoover is at the top of my auto-buy list. Without question. And she returns to her Young Adult stories in \\'Without Merit\\'. Merit Voss is a teenage girl who in addition to the normal angst of young adulthood, lives in a very unconventional household. From her perspective, her family is just plain WEIRD. No one can seem to get along and most poignantly, no one really seems to notice Merit at all. She almost seems like an afterthought. \\n \"I can say with certainty that we live in the most unusual house in this whole town. I say house because it is certainly not a home. And inside this house are seven of the most unusual occupants. No one would be able to determine from the outside of our house that our family of seven includes an atheist, a home wrecker, an ex-wife suffering from a severe case of agoraphobia, and a teenage girl whose weird obsession borders on necrophilia. \\n Of course, Merit is a classic unreliable narrator and slowly the truth about her family emerges. Colleen Hoover knows how to treat delicate subjects with great dignity and care. She makes the entire cast of odd characters here sympathetic and very likable even though you may think the opposite of them at first. \\n Merit decides to just stop attending school. No one seems to even notice! While skipping school she meets a cute guy and they share an earth-shattering kiss. BUT Merit actually has a twin sister named Honor and the cute guy is actually Sagan, her twin\\'s boyfriend. It seems as though Sagan might have thought he was kissing Honor. \\n Merit is angry and surly and can\\'t seem to make many friends. She is offended when Sagan starts eating meals with the family and basically moving in. How could this have happened? \\n \"I\\'m confused by two things. One being the constant and repeated presence of Honor\\'s boyfriend at our breakfast table. Two being the fact that everyone seems to know him so well that they\\'re perfectly fi',\n",

And this one started off very strong for me! I loved the premise of the story: ugly-duckling Rana finds her childhood friend Landon online when she is drunk one night and calls him and unleashes years of pent-up frustration. Rana grew up very poor in Michigan and her family rented their apartment from Landon\\'s family. She was forced to suddenly move when she was young and lost touch with her former best friend Landon. \\n However, the truth turns out to be a little different than what Rana was told and she and Landon begin to talk on the phone and it becomes very clear they both have very strong feelings for each other. \\n Penelope Ward is the queen of second-chance romance as well as creating a sold backstory for her characters. I didn\\'t quite feel that connection between Rana and Landon but many readers loved this one so definitely give it a try. The story has some very valuable messages about self-esteem and forgiveness. And the sexy times are incredibly HOT!! I would have liked a little more build-up to the full-blown relationship between Landon and Rana. BUT I did fall in the love with Landon: like all of Ms. Ward\\'s main characters, he is simply unforgettable!! \\n His hands may have been calloused; his arms may have been inked; he may have looked dangerous, but Landon was as gentle as he was protective. \\n \\'Drunk Dial\\' is a light and sexy story that delivers a HEA. While it is not my favorite Penelope Ward book, I nonetheless enjoyed reading it and loved the second-chance, friends to lovers storyline. This is a sexy, passionate and often funny book with lots of emotion. Enjoy Landon Roderick! I know I did. \\n Our story was a lot like a Rubik\\'s Cube - colourful and complicated. It took years to work it out, but then suddenly like magic, on a random Sunday, everything all came together. \\n (ARC provided in return for an hon',\n",

       "  'If you love a sweet, verrrry sexy, low-angst romance, then this is the book for you! Vi Keeland and Penelope Ward cooked up another very readable yet super-hot contemporary romance. \\n Dr. Simon Hogue is a sexy British physician who meets single-mom Bridget in the cutest way possible. Both are single: Bridget is a widowed nurse with not much of a social life and Simon is a gorgeous doctor with no interest in a relationship. \\n There\\'s tons of humor, sexy talk and a hottie British doctor. What\\'s not to love? After an embarrassing \"meet cute\" with Simon, Bridget ends up renting a room in her home to him in order to make ends meet. It\\'s not permanent: Simon is only in the US to complete his residency and then he will be back off to Britain. He loves to tease Bridget and their attraction is mutual. So he proposes a deal: a no-strings attached, sex-only relationship until he leaves. \\n The authors put a fresh spin on the friends-to-lovers trope that is sexy and enticing. There\\'s not much angst but the storyline is fast-paced and engaging. Bridget doesn\\'t want her son to get too attached to Simon so she is careful not to get attached. But Simon soon finds himself falling in love with Bridget and her son, too. \\n \"The sexy, blond, god of a doctor whom I\\'d masturbated to for weeks after the fish hook incident...was now my roommate.\" \\n This is a swoony romance with lots of heart and tons of heat. The authors always throw in a twist for dramatic tension and it worked perfectly here! The letter-writing is a cute addition and I loved the funny, charming, dirty-talking Brit!! Another passionate, sweet and heart-warming story from a great writing duo. \\n \"It\\'s proof you hooked me from the very beginning, luv.\" \\n (ARC provided in return for an honest review.)',\n",

Nothing too over the top here, just a sweet and sexy small-town romance featuring one hot cop and a feisty heroine. \\n Leah is determined to own the bar where she works and I loved that aspect of the book. The author also seems to have a wicked sense of humor which shows in the funny banter and the hilarious Matthew McConaughey references. Leah lost her first love to an overdose, and he also happened to be Adam's best friend - Adam, the rigid, by-the-book policeman who seems determined to punish Leah for her past mistakes. \\n Adam is charitable and gorgeous and kind and protective. He has made it his mission in life to rid the town of narcotics. When Leah is sentenced to community service under Adam's supervision, the sparks begin to fly. \\n Even though the setting is in the Midwest, this story has almost a sassy, Southern feel to it, reminiscent of Abbi Glines and Harper Sloan's early books. I love a blue-collar hero and Luke fits the bill perfectly! \\n Adam was cold and harsh and downright mean for much of the story, until Leah begins to break through to him. The chemistry between these two was HOT HOT HOT! I applaud Ms. Colette for her strong and sassy heroine and absolutely loved Leah. She wasn't just a party girl and earns the respect of everyone around her. 'Wrecked' is a funny, sexy, small-town romance that is a great way to spend a few hours. \\n ARC provided by the author in return for an honest review.\",\n",

I can\\'t promise I\\'ll do what\\'s best and walk away next time...\" \\n Fancy a fast-paced, well-written sexy romance? \\'The Forbidden\\' is all that and more!! This is not so much a taboo romance as it is the story of two people who simply meet at the wrong time. Annie is an up-and-coming, career-driven architect who has no time for relationships. She has just never felt that \"spark\" with any man. Jack and Annie meet one night in a bar when she is out for a fun night with friends. They have an immediate connection that only Jodi-Ellen Malpas can make seem SO real. \\n Jack\\'s marriage was over long before he met Annie. While some might see this as a bright line that should never be crossed, Jack instead seemed to me to be sweet, vulnerable and craving an intimate connection. Annie for one cannot believe she has found herself in this situation but Jack is everything she never knew she wanted. \\n \"I would never have put myself in this situation for anything less than powerful love. The kind that keeps you going. The kind that gives you breath and life. Jack\\'s my life. He\\'s my pulse. He\\'s everything.\" \\n This story would be empty and unconvincing in the hands of a less talented writer. But JEM really creates nuanced characters with hard choices to make. Nothing is black and white here. While the story got a little too over-dramatic for me near the end, I nonetheless loved this book and highly recommend it! \\n \"I\\'m in hell and I\\'m in heaven.

       "  'The First Taste features Andrew, a single dad from Slip of the Tongue, one of my favorite books. His story is a standalone, and does NOT feature any forbidden romance. Andrew is the complete opposite of Amelia, the boss of his sister and a total Type-A workaholic. She has been burned by a painful split from her husband and is going through a very difficult divorce. Amelia and Andrew make is clear from the start they are both only looking for a one-night stand, with no strings attached. Andrew does not suffer from lack of women, that\\'s for sure - he\\'s totally hot, has his own business and has an adorable daughter named Bell, who is raising on his own. \\n They are both completely honest with each other from the start but begin to develop a deeper connection. Their emotional relationship develops slowly, even though they both are wary of getting close. Amelia is stunning, smart and self-sufficient, Never in a million years does she think she could ever fall for a man like Andrew! And Andrew\\'s daughter comes first, even while it becomes obvious his daughter would love for him to fall in love. I loved that Andrew was the one who actually starts to realize that he is falling in love with Amelia and wants more from her. \\n Somewhere along the way, she became worth it to me. The threat of pain that comes with keeping her in my life--it\\'s not enough to scare me away. In fact, it\\'s the threat of competition that stokes a fire in me. It makes me want to put up a fight. \\n The First Taste is a classic opposites-attract story, filled with real emotion and characters that have depth and honesty. Jessica Hawkins is great at writing uber-sexy men and Andrew is not only gorgeous and tatted, he is a VERY giving lover. The sexy times in The First Taste are without a doubt some of the steamiest around. \\n \"I want to undress you, stretch you out on my bed, fingers to toes. Your hair splayed on my pillow and I want to take you over and over until you can\\'t handle it another second.\" \\n I love',\n",

BOOK. \\n A sharp and insightful commentary on our modern culture and obsession with celebrity, \\'The Idea of You\\' is also a fantastic, sexy romance. This book really did it for me. If this is Robinne Lee\\'s first book, I cannot wait see what comes next! \\n Solene is a sophisticated, 39 year old divorced working mom who finds herself swept up into an exciting and sexy relationship with the world-famous Hayes Campbell, the 20 year old member of a famous \"boy band\". She is an educated and successful gallerist who is divorced from her ex-husband, who has a younger girlfriend. The world does not take kindly to Solene\\'s relationship with Hayes, mainly because of the 20 year age difference. I loved the commentary on ageism in our society today. The public will accept an older man with a younger girlfriend but frowns upon the older woman/younger man dynamic. \\n Solene is acutely aware of the age difference but is enjoying an awakening of sorts with Hayes, Ah, the joys of a younger boyfriend! What starts out as \"just lunch\" soon becomes much, much more. \\n \"I just want to look at you for a moment.\" \\n \"You\\'ve been looking at me for over an hour.\" \\n \"Yeah, but before I was trying not to be obvious about it. Come here.\" He led me over to the daybed against the far wall and pulled me onto his lap. I could feel him through his pants. Oh, the wonders of twenty. \\n Solene at first tries to hide her relationship with Hayes from her young daughter. I knew this was going to be a disaster and her daughter at first does not handle the news well at all. But doesn\\'t Solene deserve to be happy? She struggles not only with her ex-husband\\'s reaction to the news but also with her daughter\\'s. \\n The entire time Isabelle had been just across the hall on the phone with her friend, oblivious to her mother going down the rabbit hole.

If you are looking for something totally light and sexy, this book is for you! \\n Madeleine is an adorable and quirky heroine who is trying her best to get her life together. As a somewhat unsuccessful realtor, she adores her giant dog named Mouse (cute, right?) and loves her family and best friend Daisy. But her love life? Non-existent. DOA. That is, until the new veterinarian Dr. Adam Foxe arrives in town. But the good doctor is coming off a bitter break-up and is cynical and not looking for love, etc etc. Until Mouse (and Madeleine crash into his life!) \\n They strike up a mutually beneficial deal. A fake dating arrangement to satisfy Adam\\'s nosy family and he will buy a house through Madeleine. Let the hilarity (and hormones) ensue! \\n \"No. No. A family barbecue is serious! This was not part of the deal.\" \\n \"Technically, you agreed to do anything I needed you to do.\" \\n \"That\\'s when I thought you\\'d be asking me for a lung or something!\" \\n \"So you were prepared to donate an organ, but a family barbecue is suddenly too much pressure?\" \\n \"Don\\'t try to be cute.\" \\n Adam\\'s family is charmed by Madeleine. And who wouldn\\'t be? She is a sincere and honest and refreshingly REAL MC. \\n \"And you brought cookies?\" she asks, eyeing the Tupperware in my hand. \\n \"Freshly baked this morning,\" I brag. \\n She turns over her shoulder to Adam, who\\'s following us into the house with Mouse by his side. \"I love her already!\" \\n I bask in her praise. After the months from hell I\\'ve had recently, this is a much-needed reprieve. Hell, if all else fails, maybe I\\'ll date Adam\\'s mom? \\n \\'The Foxe & the Hound\" is a delightfully sexy story with the perfect amount of humor and heat.

Faced with racism from a young age, he clawed his way to the top and created one of the most feared and most successful illegal businesses on the West Coast of Florida. He is Boss. When a large debt is owed to him, he sets out to collect. \\n He kidnaps the daughter of the man who owes him, but Christy Chapman is not at all what he expected. Anthony has preconceived notions about her which turn out to be all wrong. \\n Christy judged Anthony at first, too. Not quite the pampered heiress that Anthony thought she was, they both surprise each other along the way. \\n Although I finished this book, it was a little slow going for me at times. The third-person voice prevented me from really connecting with these characters. That being said, this was an incredibly inventive story and as always, I ADORE the Florida setting of Beth Flynn's books. The colorful characters and unflinching violence add to the genuine feel of the plot. I hope that there are more books planned for the Beth Flynn's cast of characters because I will be first in line to read her next book! \\n ARC provided by the author in return for an honest review.\",\n",

       "  '4.5 - 5 Stars!! \\n \"When life happened, it did it in a heartbeat. That space between time. A first inhale, a last exhale. The dawn of realization, the eve of what was and never again would be.\" \\n What an unexpected and refreshing surprise!!! This book is unlike anything I\\'ve ever read. And please don\\'t read any spoilers! The author just totally blew me away with the plot and the characters and the FEELS! \\n Let me just say that Parker was one of my favorite MC\\'s EVER. Strong, funny, self-deprecating, she is basically just waiting for her life to begin. She has a chip on her shoulder and blames everyone else for the position she\\'s in. But there is so much more to her story!! \\n \"If Amazon Prime offered a life, she would have one-clicked the hell out of it and selected recurring monthly delivery.\" \\n This book is NOT what you think. The plot is inventive and sexy and emotional. It is pure Jewel E. Ann. This book took me on a rollercoaster ride of emotions and I did not want it to end! Parker finds herself in THE one situation that she swore she would never be in. Funny how life is, right? Despite her best intentions, she realizes that life is not black and white but is shades of grey. And family does mean everything. \\n \"Temptation no longer resided in his blind spot. She lived a hundred yards away. \\n This book is funny and steamy and just plain REAL. I am trying not to give away any of the plot because this book is best read without knowing anything about the story or the characters. It is another delightfully different story from one of the best indie authors writing today. Pick up \\'When Life Happened.\\' You will be delighted and challenged and entertained. \\n The truth doesn\\'t always set you free, and lies are not always deception. \\n (ARC provided by the author in return for an honest review.)',\n",

       "  '4.5 Captivating Stars!!! \\n \"When truth is replaced by silence, the silence is a lie.\" \\n -- Yevgeny Yevtushenko \\n \\'The Child\\'s is a haunting and emotional character-driven suspense novel that also explores our modern-day obsession with 24/7 news. \\n Angela\\'s newborn baby was kidnapped from her hospital room several decades earlier. The baby was never found. Angela and her husband Nick carried on after their devastating loss but Angela never fully recovered. When the bones of an infant are found at a construction site, she is sure the body is that of her long-gone Baby Alice. \\n Kate is a brilliant newspaper journalist who uncovers news stories the old-fashioned way: through leg work and research and determination. She was also featured in the author\\'s previous book \\'The Widow\\' which I am now going to read! I loved Kate\\'s style. While this book started off just a tiny bit slow, it picked up the pace in the middle and thundered toward an unbelievably shocking conclusion. \\n \"I\\'ve always thought that\\'s a funny saying. Let sleeping dogs lie. Because sleeping dogs always wake up eventually, don\\'t they?\" \\n Emma is married to a university professor many years her senior. She is devastated by the news of the \"Building Site Baby\\' but why? She has no apparent ties to Angela\\'s family. Emma has had a difficult relationship with her mother Jude but it seems the two are trying to make peace with each other now that Emma is grown and married. But Emma has secrets of her own that will devastate everyone close to her when they are revealed. \\n The multiple points of view are executed brilliantly. Each narrator has their own unique voice and are each vital to the story. \\n \\'The Child\\' is an imaginative and surprising thriller. While the writing is filled with British slang and customs, that only added to my enjoyment of the story. \\n There are many twists and turns to this book and the ending was far more touching than I expected from what I though would be a suspense novel.

       "  'Such a sweet and sexy story! Highly recommend this one for fans of KA - this book is all about a strong heroine; a stand-up, Alpha hero; and some fast-moving danger. Loved the descriptions of the breathtaking Montana scenery. \\n I\\'m a HUGE fan of second-chance romance and this one fit the bill perfectly. This is the second book in the Jamison Valley series and centers around Nick, Jesse\\'s friend. (This book can be read as a standalone but I HIGHLY recommend the first book because it is fantastic!) It\\'s no spoiler that Nick and Emmeline (Emmy) were married in Las Vegas many years earlier and surprise! They meet up again very unexpectedly after many years apart, when she moves to his small town. \\n \"Nick?\" Gigi asked, but I didn\\'t speak or take my eyes off Emmy. She was frozen just like I was. Finally, Emmy broke away. \\n \"Sorry. I have to go,\" she mumbled before racing to the door. \\n \"What was that? Do you know her?\" Jess asked. \\n Yeah. I knew her. \"She\\'s my wife.\" \\n There is a delicious slow-burn aspect to this story even though Nick and Emmy are still legally married. Emmy now has a boyfriend, and had given up ever finding Nick after years of searching turned up nothing (there\\'s a good reason for that which is revealed later in the book!). Nick broke her heart when he left her after their impulsive wedding in Vegas. Emmy and Nick were from two very different worlds, but now their paths have crossed again when she takes a teaching job in Prescott, Montana. \\n Nick is a sexy and sweet Alpha but Emmy resists him despite his incredibly tender and romantic gestures. Even though they are husband and wife, they really didn\\'t know each other at all. If you are a fan of small-town romance, you will love this book. There is plenty of action and just the right amount of heat. Although story did not have the \"wow\" factor that \\'The Coppersmith Farmhouse\\' had, I still raced through this book and absolutely fell in love with the characters. \\n I am obsessed with this series and cannot',\n",

       "  '\"Now I know how much there is to be afraid of and it terrifies me. But at the same time, I feel like if I could live through that, what happened to us, then I can survive anything. Like, what is there really to be afraid of?\" \\n This book has SO much going for it! A Bittersweet, friends-to-lovers story; a feisty and relatable heroine; AND a bad-boy hero. Kylie Scott is one of my favorite authors and \\'Lick\\' remains one of my top favorite contemporary romance books. For those reasons, I stuck with this story and I\\'m so glad that I did. Edie is VERY different from most fictional heroines and for that, I applaud Ms. Scott. For once, the ordinary girl gets the guy! \\n \"Kissing John was everything. Well, not everything everything. I wouldn\\'t die without him. But all of me wanted him, my heart and my head and all of the rest. Without a doubt, he made life better.\" \\n John and Edie experienced a life-changing trauma and it pretty much bonds them together. No one else can understand what they went through that fateful night at the convenience story and they have a tough time relating to their teachers, families and friends. They end up attending the same high school and I loved what the author had to say about bullying, fat-shaming and teenage angst. There are some light-hearted moments in this story as well and if Ms. Scott writes more YA novels, I will be first in line! With that said, there were some minor inconsistencies that took me out of the story a bit (there seemed to be some Aussie-speak thrown in - no American teenager uses some of the language that the author used) but all in all this was a sweet, funny and sexy romance that kept me turning the pages until the very end. \\n \"You\\'re here?\" \\n \"Yeah.\" \\n \"Why?\" \\n \"Because this is where you are,\" he said, as if it were obvious. \\n (ARC provided by the publisher in return for an honest review.)',\n",
